# Timeline of Key Programming Languages

## 1. Machine Code
- **Year Created:** 1940s
- **Interesting Fact:** Machine code consists of binary instructions that a computer's CPU can execute directly. Early programmers had to write programs entirely in 0s and 1s.

## 2. Assembly Language
- **Year Created:** 1949
- **Interesting Fact:** Assembly language introduced human-readable mnemonics instead of binary code, making programming slightly easier while still being close to the hardware.

## 3. FORTRAN
- **Year Created:** 1957
- **Interesting Fact:** FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) was the first high-level programming language widely used for scientific and engineering calculations. It's still used in physics simulations today.

## 4. COBOL
- **Year Created:** 1959
- **Interesting Fact:** COBOL (COmmon Business-Oriented Language) was designed for business applications, especially for managing databases and financial systems.

## 5. C
- **Year Created:** 1972
- **Interesting Fact:** C is a powerful general-purpose language that influenced many modern languages like C++, Java, and Go. It’s widely used in system programming.

## 6. Java
- **Year Created:** 1995
- **Interesting Fact:** Java introduced the concept of "write once, run anywhere," allowing programs to run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 7. Python
- **Year Created:** 1991
- **Interesting Fact:** Python emphasizes readability and simplicity, making it popular for beginners and widely used in AI, data analysis, and web development.

## 8. JavaScript
- **Year Created:** 1995
- **Interesting Fact:** JavaScript is the most popular language for creating interactive web pages. Modern updates like ES6 (2015) added features such as arrow functions, promises, and destructuring.
